		               						We do more than just mail medications to our patients. We are participants in the healthcare management process working with our patient's case managers and doctors.	
		               						
		               						Adherence is critical to healthcare management!

                                            <li>MedExpress calls the doctors when refills are expiring so that:</li>
                                            <li>Medications will not be interrupted.</li>
                                            <li>We are immediately aware of any changes in medication regimens.</li>
                                            <li>If necessary, we can serve as the liaison between the doctor and our patients, often reminding them that they need to visit their doctor.</li>
                                            <li>MedExpress does ALL of the insurance paperwork, relieving both the patients and their case managers of this daunting activity.</li>
