				<p>			 	 	
					MedExpress was originally founded in 1995 by the National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA), the national voice for everyone affected by HIV and AIDS.
					We now serve patients facing many other chronic issues in their lives such as diabetes, fertility, transplant, oncology treatments as well as senior citizens who often face hundreds of dollars each month in medication costs.

				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span6">
						<h2>Compliance - Take your meds!</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>Compliance:</strong> 
							It is reported that 30-40% of prescribed medications are never taken.  A failure to comply with a medication regimen often results in the medication not working.
					        Recognizing the critical need for our patients to take their medications, we call each member each month to make sure they have been taking their medications and to confirm that a refill is due.
